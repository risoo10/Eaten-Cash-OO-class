# EatenCash

This is the project I did during my first year at University (FIIT at  STU BA) for the Object Oriented Programming class.

It is a simple Java project with my first implementation of MVC architecture pattern in Java. 
GUI was constracted using outdated Swing components and model was Serializes from file.
